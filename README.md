# Online Scientific Calculator

This is an easy to use online scientific calculator.

## Tools used to build this project

To manage the workflow for this project I have used NPM and Gulp.js.

For the look and feel I have used HTML5, SASS, Compass and Autoprefixer.

For the functionality I have used CoffeeScript.

For the version control I have used Git and Github.

### ToDo:

* Finish coffeescript code off
    * functionality for "."

* Possible another image on right side?
* Add copyright text back in?
