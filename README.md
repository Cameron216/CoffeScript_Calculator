# Online Calculator

This is an easy to use online calculator.

## Tools used to build this project

To manage the workflow for this project I have used NPM and Gulp.js.

For the look and feel I have used HTML5, SASS, Compass and Autoprefixer.

For the functionality I have used CoffeeScript and JQuery.

For the version control I have used Git and Github.

### ToDo:

* Finish coffeescript code off:
    * functionality for "."
* Turn the calculator into a scientific one
