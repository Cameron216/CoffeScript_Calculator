# Online Scientific Calculator

This is an easy to use online scientific calculator.

## Tools used to build this project

To manage the workflow for this project I have used NPM and Gulp.js.

For the look and feel I have used HTML5, SASS, Compass and Autoprefixer.

For the functionality I have used CoffeeScript.

For the version control I have used Git and Github.

### ToDo:

-Add some background images (maybe some stickmen learning?)

-Finish coffeescript code off
    *functionality for NaN
    *functionality for operators other than = to do the operations
    *functionality for pervious display to show correctly the previous inputs
    *show current sum somewhere all the time?
    *mobile optimize?
